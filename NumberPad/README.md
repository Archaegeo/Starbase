NOTE: This is a generic example that supports assigning entered number to a user defined variable.

The comments in the code can be left out of course, but here they are for how to use the system.
1. :1 to :0 are number buttons first field name.  The On value is the number (i.e. :5 on value is 5), the off value is 0. The ButtonStyle must be 1.
1. :ent :clr are enter and clear buttons first field name.  On value is 1, off value is 0. The ButtonStyle must be 1.
1. :neg is the negative button first field name.  On value is -1, off value is 1. The ButtonStyle must be 1.
1. :dec is the decimal button first field name.  On value is 1000, off value is 1. The ButtonStyle must be 1.
1. :Entry is the number panel display.  :dbg is the variable the final number will be assigned to, rename this as needed.
1. To use: press negative or decimals if needed. Enter the numbers one at a time, making sure they appear on the Entry panel. When complete hit Enter button to assign it to your :dbg variable.  You can press Clear button to start over.
